Conversion of existing HPLC Simulator Java applet to Javascript/HTML web application done by Michael C. Libby (m@mlibby.com or https://github.com/mlibby).

HPLC Simulator originally started as an Excel spreadsheet that <a href="http://www.chem.umn.edu/groups/carr/1carr.html">Peter Carr</a>, professor of chemistry at the University of Minnesota, created as a tool for his students. <a href="http://boswell.cfans.umn.edu">Paul Boswell</a>, research assistant professor at the University of Minnesota, and <a href="http://homepages.gac.edu/~dstoll/">Dwight Stoll</a>, assistant professor of chemistry at Gustavus Adolphus College (St. Peter, MN) created a web-based version of the HPLC simulator.
